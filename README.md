# The Perfect Site 1.1

*The Perfect Website. It's fast (I mean really FAST). It's responsive. Uses HTML5 and CSS3. Works in all browsers and screen sizes. Well, this is not feasible practically in real-life cases for most of the websites.*

*Forked from [iamtraction/ThePerfectSite](https://github.com/iamtraction/ThePerfectSite)*

The original ThePerfectSite is perfect, because I want to build a home page that i can put some sub page/ code block

so I add a navigation bar, some markdown style to the page, and improved the typography
